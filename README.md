# Spotify-Case-study-challenge
In this case study challenge I tried to solve the business requirement problems considering me as an analyst who get to work on the stakeholders business challenges.

## Tools used:
MySQL

## Learnings:
In day to day SQL querie writing it is pretty common to use CASE statement in SELECT clause for making bins like including users in age category like 'Young' or 'Adult' etc but through this challenge I got chance to use CASE statement in group by clase, which was really helpful in query solving.

## Impact:
I believe that the queries I have written for given business problem are very structured and much easier to follow not just seniors but any new SQL learner.
